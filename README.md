**Muzic** is a research project on AI music that empowers music understanding and generation with deep learning and artificial intelligence. 
Muzic is pronounced as [ˈmjuːzeik] and '谬贼客' (in Chinese). Besides the logo in image version (see above), Muzic also has a logo in video version (you can click here to watch <a href="https://ai-muzic.github.io/muzic_logo/"><img src="img/muzic_video_logo.PNG" title="Muzic Video Logo" height="15"/></a>). Muzic was started by [some researchers](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ai-music/) from [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/).

The current work in [Muzic](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ai-music/) include:
* Music Understanding
  + Symbolic Music Understanding: [MusicBERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05630.pdf)
  + Automatic Lyrics Transcription: [PDAugment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07940.pdf) 
* Music Generation
  + Song Writing: [SongMASS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05168.pdf)
  + Lyric Generation: [DeepRapper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.01875.pdf)
  + Melody Generation: [TeleMelody](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09617.pdf)

  + Singing Voice Synthesis: [HiFiSinger](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.01776.pdf)



## Requirements

The operating system is Linux. We test on Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS, with Python 3.6.12. The requirements for running Muzic are listed in `requirements.txt`. To install the requirements, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
We initially release the code of 5 research work: [MusicBERT](musicbert), [PDAugment](pdaugment), [DeepRapper](deeprapper), [SongMASS](songmass), and [TeleMelody](telemelody). You can find the README in the corresponding folder for detailed instructions on how to use.
